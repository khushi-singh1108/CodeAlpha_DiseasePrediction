# CodeAlpha - Disease Prediction (Breast Cancer)

This project is part of the **CodeAlpha Machine Learning Internship**.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a **classification model** that predicts whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign using the **Breast Cancer dataset** from Scikit-learn.

---

## 🧠 Dataset Information
- Dataset: `load_breast_cancer()`  
- Samples: 569  
- Features: 30 tumor characteristics  
- Classes:
  - 0 = malignant  
  - 1 = benign  

---

## 🏗️ Project Workflow
1. Loaded the Breast Cancer dataset  
2. Split the dataset into training and testing parts  
3. Scaled features using StandardScaler  
4. Trained a Logistic Regression model  
5. Generated predictions  
6. Evaluated with:
   - Accuracy  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - Classification Report  

---

## ✅ Results
- **Accuracy:** ~98%  
- Confusion matrix shows excellent classification  
- Strong precision/recall/F1 for both classes

---

## 📊 Output Screenshots
Screenshots are available in the `outputs/` folder:
- Accuracy score  
- Confusion Matrix heatmap  
- Classification Report
